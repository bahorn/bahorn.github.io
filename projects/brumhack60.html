                <p>
                    Me and Friend used to Leap Motion to control Google Chrome.
                    We sent data from his laptops to a VPS I controlled, which
                    then proxied the data to the Browser. We then assigned 
                    actions to various gestures that the leap detected.
                    It worked fairly well, but some gestures were to similar so
                    it caused it to be buggy when trying to demo it.
