                <p>
                    This is a group project. It is being built using a Lego
                    Mindstorms EV3, with the goal of using it's color sensor to
                    make it follow a path on the floor. It is also meant to
                    avoid objects in the way using the infrared sensor.
                </p>

                                Initial Research. Group started building the
                                robot. I looked into various methods of
                                programming it.

                                I took the robot home. Wrote some initial
                                code to make it avoid objects. Group
                                prepared a flow chart documenting our
                                initial ideas on the software.

                                The team got bluetooth to work. We made more
                                progress on getting the color sensor working
                                correctly with calibration. Came up with a
                                better method of making it move and follow the
                                line.

                    The built robot. We later removed some of the unneeded parts.

                    My first version of the object avoiding code. We aim to have
                    something like this as the outer loop, with the line
                    following being where the move forward code is now.
