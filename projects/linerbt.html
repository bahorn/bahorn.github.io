                <p>
                    This is a group project being built using a Lego
                    Mindstorms EV3. The goal of the projects was making it use
                    a color sensor to follow a black line on the floor, avoid
                    objects in the way by using the infrared sensor and take a
                    few commands by Bluetooth.
                </p>

                                Initial Research. Group started building the
                                robot. I looked into various methods of
                                programming it.

                                I took the robot home. Wrote some initial
                                code to make it avoid objects. Group
                                prepared a flow chart documenting our
                                initial ideas on the software.

                                The team got Bluetooth to work. We made more
                                progress on getting the color sensor working
                                correctly with calibration. Came up with a
                                better method of making it move and follow the
                                line.

                                The robot does what it is expected to do. It
                                can follow lines, turn around to avoid objects
                                in the way and start/restart depending on
                                commands provided by Bluetooth.
                                Had to research and write a document on wireless
                                communications/Bluetooth and how they are using
                                in programming the robot.

                    The built robot. We later removed some of the unneeded parts.

                    My first version of the object avoiding code. We aim to have
                    something like this as the outer loop, with the line
                    following being where the move forward code is now.
