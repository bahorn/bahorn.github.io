                <p>
                    For the second term, I did a text based RPG adventure game.
                    For this project I implemented the core engine behind the
                    game, which involved writing a zork style command parser and
                    also writing the code to deal with a SQLite Database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I implemented the command parser by making a trie which
                    contains all the valid commands in it, so when a command was
                    typed in, it would search the trie for the best function to
                    run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SQLite Database stored the state of the game so it could
                    be saved and reloaded. This was implemented by make tables
                    that represent the internal layout of each room, player
                    information, etc.
                </p>
