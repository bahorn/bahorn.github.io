                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to develop a python3 program
                    between the group that simulates a basic robot like game.
                    I implemented a UI which allows different parameters to
                    be changed for the various simulations.
                </p>
                <h2>Progress</h2>
                    <table class="projects">

                                The group worked our an design for the project.
                                I looked at the various ways of implementing my
                                UI, initially looking at doing it via a web
                                server written using Flask.
                            </td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>2</td>
                            <td>
                                Did further research and worked on the interface
                                more.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>3</td>
                            <td>
                                Changed the UI to tkinter to make the program
                                easier to integrate in the end.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>4</td>
                            <td>
                                Implemented a function to find the distance
                                between the starting point and also code to tell
                                if two robots on the map are close.
                                I wrote unit tests to test the various parts of
                                the program.
                                Attempted to integrate all the groups code
                                into a single program.
